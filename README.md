Simple Web APP built in AngularJS connecting to an API RESTFul. The APP lists the following:

- List of movies

- List of categories
- List of movies by category

The APP connects to the API located @ http://ror-movies.herokuapp.com. The endpoints are the following:

- List of movies => /api/movies
- Detail of a movie => /api/movies/{id}
- List of categories => /api/categories
